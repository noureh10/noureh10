<h2> Hello stranger !</h2>

👋 Hi <br/>

My name is Nour Echaâra, I'm 19 and I'm a first year student in computer science at the HE2B-ESI (Ecole Supérieure d'Informatique).

On my profile you'll mainly find all my personal projects. I look at some Python repositories on my lost hours. As some wise 
man once said, curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning 


<h2> Useful links </h2>


You'll find there anything you need if you need to contact me or check my references <br />
