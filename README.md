<h2> Let me talk about myself </h2>

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Nour EchaÃ¢ra,I'm 19 and I'm a first year student in computer science at the HE2B-ESI (Ecole SupÃ©rieure d'Informatique).


I always loved automation and my line of thought is if the machine can do it then it will do it. I first started scripting 
with Windows Batch which is such an easy and powerful tool to use. I mainly used it to perform repetitive tasks and I fell
in love with its simplicity.

I reached a ceilling with batch when I was interested in web automation, some of my friends told me about Selenium and the tool's perks.
So I jumped into the Python universe and its wonders. I started writing some scripts to automate boring processes and also to scrape data
of websites. Right now I'm learning on my own about advanced Python concepts as well as some data structure.
